Amanda: I w

I worked on the basic framework for the html files. I also wrote 
all of the database.py logic by incorporating the sql logic from assignment
1. On the database.py, I also reformatted the return output so that it can be
processed by reg.py. I also wrote all of the Flask logic in reg.py, 
including using the flask.request.args.get methods, calling the database 
functions, calling the flask.render_template methods. I also implemented 
all of the cookies logic in reg.py. Finally, I wrote the runserver.py main
method.

I helped Amanda with creating the regdetails and regoverviews html files. 
Specifically, I wrote the html code for adding inline CSS styling using HTML
attributes. I integrated the Flask and Django code to work concurrently with
the SQL querying. I added the testing modules to the reg.py. I worked on 
the error handling portion of the project. I also created the testing 
modules for the reg.py file. I also resolved the issues with the cookie 
and worked on the "another class search" feature. I resolved an issue with
the server not properly running.

Learnings:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The assignment helped us gain a better understanding of how to deliver
and run an application using python through routing and basic http requests,
all of which were new concepts to us. We also gained a better understanding
of using Django and Flask as well as writing HTML for the first time, which
helped our understanding of how to develop front end code.
