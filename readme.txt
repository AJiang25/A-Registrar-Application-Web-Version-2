Amanda: 

I wrote the convert to html functions, handle response functions, 
handle error functions, get overview functionss, debounced functions, and
setup function for overviews and details in the index.html. I developed the 
core logic for each function using jQuery, which provided a foundation for 
Arnold to integrate Bootstrap styling. I also worked on all of the error 
handling, including implementation and testing.

Arnold: 

I fixed the logic in the index.html file and the reg.py file to get the
application running on the webpage. I also bootstrapped the entire app in
the index.html file. This includes the sticky header, the sticky footer,
the modal, and the general div that includes the reg_overview tables. I
also worked on testing. I developed the testing suite and I also modified
the logic that Amanda had in place for the functions in the index.html file
to use AJAX instead of JQuery.

Learnings:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This assignment helped us learn how the frontend and backend components
interact in a web application. We gained a better understanding of how to
use Ajax, JSON, and jQuery, most of which were unfamiliar to us before 
doing this assignment. We also learned how to use Bootstrap. We enjoyed
making the final product and observing how the frontend styling improved 
from Assignment 3 to Assignment 4.
