Title	Advanced C%Science Programming Techniques
Description	This is a course about the practice of programming. Programming is more than just writing code. Programmers must also assess tradeoffs, choose among design alternatives, debug and test, improve performance, and maintain software written by themselves & others. At the same time, they must be concerned with compatibility, robustness, and reliability, while meeting specifications. Students will have the opportunity to develop these skills by working on their own code and in group projects.
Prerequisites	COS 217 and COS 226.

Title	Inequality: Class, Race, and Gender
Description	Using an intersectional approach to the study of inequality, this course will examine race, class and gender as interrelated systems of power that create differences in opportunities and resources for groups and individuals in U.S. society. We will study the meanings and histories of these and other dimensions of social differentiation to explore patterns that result in disparate outcomes in such areas as education, health, work, family, and poverty. Unveiling contemporary disparities and rethinking the seemingly familiar will lead to considerations of the relationship between inequality, social policy and social justice.
